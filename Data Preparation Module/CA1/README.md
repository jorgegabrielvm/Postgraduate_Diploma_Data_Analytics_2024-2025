This project explores spam email classification using the spambase.csv dataset. The analysis includes full data characterization (size, attributes, missing values) and data cleaning steps followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand key patterns. We applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify the minimum number of features required to retain 99.5% of the datasetâ€™s variance, reducing dimensionality while preserving core information. We then trained and tested classification models on both the original and PCA-reduced datasets. Results showed similar performance, validating the effectiveness of PCA in handling high-dimensional data. This project also includes an explanation of the Curse of Dimensionality and its impact on spam filtering.
