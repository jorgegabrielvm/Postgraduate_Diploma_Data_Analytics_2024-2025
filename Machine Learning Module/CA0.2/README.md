This project analyzes a global bike rental company's data using the CRISP-DM framework to uncover insights into operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and pricing strategy. It explores patterns across cities, bike types, and weather using statistical analysis and machine learning techniques. The dataset includes demographic, trip, and environmental variables. Key methods include data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, PCA, LDA, clustering, and regression modeling. Though predictive models underperformed, clustering revealed valuable customer segments for targeted marketing. Recommendations aim to optimize fleet management, boost customer experience, and guide strategic pricing, with deployment-ready insights for real-world impact.
