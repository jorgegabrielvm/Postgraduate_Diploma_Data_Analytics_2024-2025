This project analyzes video game sales data to support strategic retail decisions for the upcoming summer season. Using Python in a Jupyter Notebook, we answered key business questions through static visualizations and thorough data wrangling. Analyses include top publishers by global sales, regional sales correlations, genre popularity, sales trends over time, and developer frequency. A custom statistical question further deepens insight. Each answer is supported by a clear, well-rationalized chart, with detailed justifications for data engineering, feature selection, and visualization design choices. This static, markdown-documented report ensures clarity and aligns with business needs for actionable insights.
