This project predicts undergraduate university admission in Bangladesh using machine learning classification models. Based on academic, familial, and behavioral features (e.g., SSC GPA, HSC GPA, Family Economy, Social Media Engagement), we built and compared Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, and Tuned SVM models. The dataset was preprocessed and split using 5-fold cross-validation to prevent overfitting and ensure generalization. PCA and hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV were used to improve model performance. Random Forest outperformed all others, achieving 80% accuracy with balanced bias-variance tradeoff. Evaluation metrics, ROC curves, and confusion matrices validated the models. This project demonstrates the potential of ML in educational forecasting and admission support.
