This project applies unsupervised and collaborative filtering techniques to an online retail dataset, generating actionable insights and opportunities. We explored and justified feature selection, implemented K-Means, DBSCAN, and hierarchical clustering to segment customers and evaluate model performance. For recommendations, we engineered user–item matrices and compared memory- and model-based collaborative filtering, discussing potential content-based enhancements. We then designed a powerful interactive Streamlit dashboard tailored to 18–35 year olds, showcasing key patterns, cluster profiles, and top product recommendations with intuitive filters and charts. Data preparation steps are detailed; report interprets results and recommends optimal algorithms. Browse code to explore analyses and app.
