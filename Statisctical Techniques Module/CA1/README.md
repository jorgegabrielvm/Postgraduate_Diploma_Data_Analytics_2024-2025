This project explores factors influencing individuals’ belief that Jesus wants a personal relationship with them (“Belief_Probability”). A GDPR-compliant survey was created using Google Forms, collecting over 30 responses across multiple data types. We performed descriptive statistical analysis using measures of central tendency, dispersion, skewness, kurtosis, and normality tests. Visualizations (histograms, boxplots) revealed key insights related to age of first exposure, prayer frequency, gender, and parental beliefs. The goal is to identify patterns that could guide pastoral outreach and faith development strategies. The dataset is anonymized and saved as Data_CA1.csv.
