This project analyzes the vgsales.csv dataset to guide a retail company’s summer sales strategy. Using Python in a Jupyter Notebook, we performed data wrangling, statistical analysis, and static visualization to answer key business questions: top publishers, regional sales correlations, genre trends, generational sales performance, and developer frequency. A custom statistical analysis provided additional market insight. Each answer is paired with a well-designed, static chart, with detailed rationale for data engineering, visualization choices (e.g., color, layout, clarity), and method selection. All content is markdown-documented for professional readability, aligning with the company CTO’s technical and business expectations.
